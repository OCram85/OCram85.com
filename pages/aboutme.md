#### <i class="fa fa-calendar" aria-hidden="true"></i> 2012 - 20<i class="fa fa-question" aria-hidden="true"></i><i class="fa fa-question" aria-hidden="true"></i> <i class="fa fa-building-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> [KIVBF](https://www.kivbf.de) as **SysOp** / **DevOps Engineer**
<i class="fa fa-calendar-plus-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> **2015**&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2015 I started automating several platform and workload
related use cases. Unfortunately it's closed source, so I can't talk about details. But to give a glimpse at the
underlining technologies I can notice they were based on **Microsoft**, **VMware** and **Citrix** products.

<i class="fa fa-calendar-plus-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> **2014**&nbsp;&nbsp; As the automation team got bigger and bigger, we needed to define
standards. That's why I began using [Phabricator](https://www.phacility.com/phabricator/) as a developer framework in
combination with [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) to build our modules. This enabled us doing code review, lint tests,
unit test and building our own CI Environment.


<i class="fa fa-calendar-plus-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> **2013**&nbsp;&nbsp; I joined into a new team which was building our new cloud
infrastructure. We purposed to offer our customers IaaS, PaaS, SaaS and EaaS services. My focus shifted
to automation and cloud orchestration. Back then I started using Powershell.


<i class="fa fa-calendar-plus-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> **2012**&nbsp;&nbsp; I needed to get away from those wacky enterprise applications
which were used in the public sector. So I took the chance to work in much bigger datacenter at
[KIVBF](https://www.kivbf.de). There I ran the backup and restore solution called IBM Tivoli Storage Manager (TSM).

It was a great place to get to know such large environment and I finally started automating again. At this time I
implemented the monitoring system [Zabbix](http://www.zabbix.com/). Unfortunately I couldn't find any extension to
monitor out IBM tape library or TSM data itself. So I developed own interfaces therefore.

#### <i class="fa fa-calendar" aria-hidden="true"></i> 2008 - 2012 <i class="fa fa-building-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> [Pforzheim municipal administration](https://www.pforzheim.de/) as **SysOp**

At the municipal administration of Pforzheim I was responsible for the**Software Packaging and Deployment**,
 **MS-SQL Servers** and **Web Hosting**.
